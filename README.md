# Student-Course-Registration-Prerequisite-Checking-System-using-OOP-concepts-and-C-programming-
This program will input the university course list with their prerequisites
ONCE at the start of program by reading this information from a file. Then, whenever a student is willing to register a number
of courses, he/she will enter the courses they studied and the ones they want to
register in. The system will allow or disallow the student from registering the course
based on stored course prerequisites. The project will be implemented in C++. This
project is console based. Graphical representation of each studentâ€™s course structure
